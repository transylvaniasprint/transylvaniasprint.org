Join us for a week of Nix hacking, learning, and fun in the countryside of Transylvania, Romania.

We will stay at a guest house in the countryside, with a nice view of the forest, a good spot for hiking. The guest house provides accommodation, food, fiber internet, common spaces for hacking, and other amenities.

We aim to invite a mix of people, with intermediate to veteran Nix experience, providing an opportunity to learn from each other as well as improve the ecosystem. Accommodation is included so the event should be accessible for a wider range of people from the region, not only established professionals.
